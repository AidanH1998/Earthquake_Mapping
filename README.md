# Earthquake_Mapping

## Overview ##

The Purpose of the project is to display magnitude and earthquakes all over the world. We do this using mapbox, leaflet, geojson and d3.js. Throughout this project we learn how to style the map, so that we can see the street and buildings or just the street. We also see the lines and dots that help us display the earthquakes and the magnitude, which helps us understand what is going on, so we can see what areas have frequent earthquake and what places have large magnitude earthquakes. The West Coast of the United States might have a lot of earthquakes, but South America has higher magnitude, such that the circles are larger and red.

We can display the maps to show what is going on, but we can also hover over the circles to have a better understanding on what is going on.
